# Topology_Mapping
This is an assignment in the information systems and software course. As simulating large scale network experiments requires lots of physical resources, partitioning can be used. Topology mapping is a partitioning technique that maps the simulated nodes to different physical nodes. In this assignment, we will use spectral clustering to partition a given network topology on the available physical nodes.
